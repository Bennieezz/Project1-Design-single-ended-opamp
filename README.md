# Project1: Design single ended opamp
In this project, I designed a single-ended operational amplifier based on specifications provided by a research laboratory. I first analyzed the given performance requirements and selected an appropriate circuit architecture to meet the target gain, bandwidth, phase margin, and power constraints. I applied the gm/Id methodology to properly size all MOS transistors, ensuring an optimal trade-off between gain, speed, and power consumption.

To guarantee stability, I implemented Miller compensation and carefully evaluated the frequency response of the system. I also designed a suitable bias circuit to generate stable operating currents and voltages for all stages of the amplifier. Finally, I completed the full custom layout and performed post-layout simulations and optimizations to ensure that the design met all specified performance targets.
