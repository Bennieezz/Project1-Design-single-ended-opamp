# Project1: Design single ended opamp
I designed a single-ended operational amplifier based on research lab specifications. I selected the architecture, sized MOS transistors using the gm/Id methodology, implemented Miller compensation, designed the bias circuit, and completed layout with post-layout optimization to meet the required performance targets.
